## Ideas

This is a document where we can post our ideas as they occur. Add newest bits to the top.

## Testing

R package testthat has been recommended by some
* GitHub site - https://github.com/r-lib/testthat
* Write-up by Hadley Wickham - http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/tests.html
* Inattentional Coffee blog - https://katherinemwood.github.io/post/testthat/

Travis CI for continuous integration is popular
* Home page - https://travis-ci.org/
* Julia Silge blog - https://juliasilge.com/blog/beginners-guide-to-travis/

Preliminary look at these seems to indicate testthat is the better choice for our purposes. It seems to be set up to evaluate a structured comparison between the return value of a function and what you expect the function to produce. This should work pretty well for our modular design. 

Travis CI seems to be more for testing the version compatibility of dependent libraries.

## Possible names (still thinking of more...)

* WHOM - Woods Hole Operating Model ("whom" pronounced to rhyme with "qualm" as in the Woody Allen movie)
* WHSPR - Woods Hole Simulation Project in R (subtle link to WHAM, who has a song "Careless Whisper")
* SimSAM - Simulator for Stock Assessment Methods (perhaps too close to SISAM)
* WHEEP - Woods Hole Experimenting on Exploited Populations (as in read 'em and)
* WHONDER - Woods Hole Open Numeric Determination of Exploited Resources (as in one hit, but a real stretch on the acronym)
