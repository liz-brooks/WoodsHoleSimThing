## Ideas

This is a document where we can post our ideas as they occur. Add newest bits to the top.

## Testing

R package testthat has been recommended by some
* GitHub site - https://github.com/r-lib/testthat
* Write-up by Hadley Wickham - http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/tests.html
* Inattentional Coffee blog - https://katherinemwood.github.io/post/testthat/

Travis CI for continuous integration is popular
* Home page - https://travis-ci.org/
* Julia Silge blog - https://juliasilge.com/blog/beginners-guide-to-travis/


## Possible names (still thinking of more...)

* WHOM - Woods Hole Operating Model ("whom" pronounced to rhyme with "qualm" as in the Woody Allen movie)
* WHSPR - Woods Hole Simulation Project in R (subtle link to WHAM, who has a song "Careless Whisper")
* SimSAM - Simulator for Stock Assessment Methods (perhaps too close to SISAM)
* WHEEP - Woods Hole Experimenting on Exploited Populations (as in read 'em and)
* WHONDER - Woods Hole Open Numeric Determination of Exploited Resources (as in one hit, but a real stretch on the acronym)
