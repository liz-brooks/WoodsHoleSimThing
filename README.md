# WoodsHoleSimThing

Project Notes 10/19/18:
The idea here is to create a population simulation engine that can feed ASAP/SAM/VPA assessment models seemlessly. We intend to build using modular design to facilitate group coding. 

Goals (things to think about while building):

Power analysis of survey sampling: Sampling request tool.

How should error be incorporated - build in flexibility.

How should we incorpate bias?

Read in ASAP file to establish starting conditions?

Risk policy analysis? Control rules? 

Documentation maybe via Roxygen (should be done as coding occurs)

Think about data structures.

Functions should be as general as possible so they can be used in other projects. 

Spatial components may be added later so think about how that might be done.

Same for sexes.

Look at Github testing - should probably use this before pushing things up.

What outputs do we need?
